# DDIM-mRNA-Display
This repository contains all code, pretrained models, and relevant data used in the manuscript titled:  "A Route to Design Novel Functional Peptides by Applying a Denoising Diffusion Model to mRNA Display Libraries"

We developed and applied a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to generate novel peptide ligands targeting the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL. This repository supports reproducibility of our findings and provides resources for others to extend or adapt the method for related ligand discovery tasks.
